# CodeKatas

Welcome to my very first experience with code katas! I took on the challenge of solving the Red Pencil Code Kata using Python. This is specifically a challenge to me because I have very little experience with Python (a few hours of self-teach now and then). I have used the resources available to me and asked anyone I can for helpful hints/advice. After a few hours of trial and error, I am much more comfortable with Python and unit testing/TDD than ever before.

Next, I used Javascript to solve the String Calculator Code Kata.

There is no better way to learn a new language in-depth than using it to solve a problem!

Here you can find the code katas I attempted to solve:
