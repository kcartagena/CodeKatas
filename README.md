# CodeKatas

Welcome to my very first experience with code katas! 

WORK IN PROGRESS: I used JavaScript to attempt a solution for the String Calculator Code Kata. This is still a work in progress due to many Mocha, Chai, and IntelliJ challenges. I have encountered an error with the export statement and no successful solution yet. IntelliJ needs a JDK for module 'mocha'. Again, I have not found a successful solution yet. After a lot of research and watching other examples, I went ahead and created some tests and the code I believe *should* make it work. I look forward to coming back to update this with news of a successful run!

*UPDATE:*
  I was finally able to get my first failing test! Now, I am off to write some code that should ACTUALLY make it work.

I took on the challenge of solving the Red Pencil Code Kata using Python. This is specifically a challenge to me because I have very little experience with Python (a few hours of self-teach now and then). I have used the resources available to me and asked anyone I could for helpful hints/advice. After a few hours of trial and error, I am much more comfortable with Python and unit testing/TDD than ever before.

There is no better way to learn a new language in-depth than using it to solve a problem!

Here you can find the code katas and attempt to solve them too:
